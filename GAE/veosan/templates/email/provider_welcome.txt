Hi $(first_name)s,

My name is David, and I want to personally welcome you to the Veosan family.

I don't want to take up too much of your time, just wanted to introduce myself and let you know that i will be your main contact with the Veosan team. Should you need any help, have any comments or want to suggest changes/additions to the site, please feel free to shoot me an email or drop me a line.

I also want to present some tips to get the most out of our site:
* Upload a photo
* Fill in your CV
* Invite some friends
* Complete your schedule
* Check out our blog

We think Veosan is the ultimate tool for marketing your practice, expanding your referral network and finding new patients. 

Veosan is a community the more members we have the stronger our community becomes. If you can think of anyone else who you think would benefit from joining Veosan please invite them by using the network tab of your profile.

Thank you and enjoy the service!
