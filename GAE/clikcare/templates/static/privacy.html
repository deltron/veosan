		<h2>Preamble</h2>
		<p>
			This Master Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains the collection, use, and disclosure of “personal information” by veosan, Inc. (“veosan”), a <span style="background:yellow">Massachusetts Corporation, with its principal place of business at 444 Castro Street, Suite 900, Mountain View, CA 94041, USA</span>. This Privacy Policy includes products and services provided through websites that veosan operates, which include, but are not limited to, http://veosan.com and http://clikhealth.com (collectively, together with all sub-domains thereof, the “Websites”). Furthermore, this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of the websites operated by affiliates of veosan.
		</p>

		<p>
			This Privacy Policy also explains our commitment to you with respect to our use and disclosure of non personal browsing and site usage data that veosan collects as the provider of the website. <span style="background:orange">That commitment is contained in a “Data Usage Policy,” below</span>.
		</p>

		<p>
			As used in this policy, “personal information” means information that would allow a party to identify you such as, for example, your name, address or location, telephone number or email address.
		</p>

		<p>
			By accessing the Websites or using veosan as your service provider, you are accepting and agreeing to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
		</p>

		<h2>Website Visitors </h2>
		<p>
			Like most website operators, veosan collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. veosan’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how veosan’s visitors use its website. From time to time, veosan may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
		</p>
		<p>
			veosan also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users <span style="background:orange">booking appointments</span>. veosan only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
		</p>

		<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
		<p>
			Certain visitors to veosan’s websites choose to interact with veosan in ways that require veosan to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that veosan gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Those who engage in transactions with veosan – <span style="background:orange">by booking an appointment or offering services, for example</span> – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, veosan collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with veosan. veosan does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
		</p>

		<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
		<p>
			veosan may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, veosan may monitor the <span style="background:orange">most popular cities and service providers on the site in order to refine the matching engine</span>. veosan may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, veosan does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
		</p>

		<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
		<p>
			veosan discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on veosan’s behalf or to provide services available at veosan’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using veosan’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. veosan will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, veosan discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when veosan believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of veosan, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an veosan website and have supplied your email address, veosan may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with veosan and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. veosan takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
		</p>

		<h2>Cookies</h2>
		<p>
			A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. veosan uses cookies to help veosan identify and track visitors, their usage of veosan website, and their website access preferences. veosan visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using veosan’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of veosan’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
		</p>

		<h2>Business Transfers</h2>
		<p>
			If veosan, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that veosan goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of veosan may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
		</p>

		<h2>Ads</h2>
		<p>
			Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by veosan and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
		</p>

		<h2>Third-Party Sites</h2>
		<p>
			The Websites may include links to other websites. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party sites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other websites.
		</p>

		<h2>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p>
			We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also revise the Effective Date below. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the personal information we collect. Your continued use of the Websites constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates.
