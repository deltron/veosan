		<h2>Preamble</h2>
		<p>
			This Master Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains the collection, use, and disclosure of “personal information” by ClikSante, Inc. (“ClikSante”), a zzzzMassachusetts Corporation, with its principal place of business at 444 Castro Street, Suite 900, Mountain View, CA 94041, USA. This Privacy Policy includes products and services provided through websites that ClikSante operates, which include, but are not limited to,.... (collectively, together with all sub-domains thereof including, without limitation, http://learn.creativecommons.org, http://opened.creativecommons.org (“OpenEd Website”), and http://discovered.creativecommons.org/search, the “Websites”). Furthermore, this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of the websites operated by affiliates of ClikSante.
		</p>

		<p>
			This Privacy Policy also explains our commitment to you with respect to our use and disclosure of non personal browsing and site usage data that ClikSante collects as the provider of the website. That commitment is contained in a “Data Usage Policy,” below.
		</p>

		<p>
			As used in this policy, “personal information” means information that would allow a party to identify you such as, for example, your name, address or location, telephone number or email address.
		</p>

		<p>
			By accessing the Websites or using ClikSante as your service provider, you are accepting and agreeing to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
		</p>

		<h2>Website Visitors </h2>
		<p>
			Like most website operators, ClikSante collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. ClikSante’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how ClikSante’s visitors use its website. From time to time, ClikSante may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
		</p>
		<p>
			ClikSante also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on WordPress.com blogs. ClikSante only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.
		</p>

		<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
		<p>
			Certain visitors to ClikSante’s websites choose to interact with ClikSante in ways that require ClikSante to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that ClikSante gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at WordPress.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with ClikSante – by purchasing access to the Akismet comment spam prevention service, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, ClikSante collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with ClikSante. ClikSante does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
		</p>

		<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
		<p>
			ClikSante may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, ClikSante may monitor the most popular blogs on the WordPress.com site or use spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam. ClikSante may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, ClikSante does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
		</p>

		<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
		<h3>* need to rewrite this</h3>
		<p>
			ClikSante discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on ClikSante’s behalf or to provide services available at ClikSante’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using ClikSante’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. ClikSante will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, ClikSante discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when ClikSante believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of ClikSante, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an ClikSante website and have supplied your email address, ClikSante may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with ClikSante and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. ClikSante takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
		</p>

		<h2>Cookies</h2>
		<p>
			A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. ClikSante uses cookies to help ClikSante identify and track visitors, their usage of ClikSante website, and their website access preferences. ClikSante visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using ClikSante’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of ClikSante’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
		</p>

		<h2>Business Transfers</h2>
		<p>
			If ClikSante, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that ClikSante goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of ClikSante may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
		</p>

		<h2>Ads</h2>
		<p>
			Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by ClikSante and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
		</p>

		<h2>Third-Party Sites</h2>
		<p>
			The Websites may include links to other websites. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party sites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other websites.
		</p>

		<h2>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p>
			We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also revise the Effective Date below. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the personal information we collect. Your continued use of the Websites constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates.
